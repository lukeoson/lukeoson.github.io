I know people who never went to university and found what they love at 18. I know people who have children and are single, I know people who are married and had to wait 8-10 years to be parents.

> Long story short... they forgot that they are all brothers and sisters, co-habiting the same planet, so they kinda became delusional and imagined these invisible boarders, beliefs and structures separating them, and started destroying each other and the earth they live on ... instead of just living, sharing, creating and evolving together.

My own opinion is that belief is the death of intelligence.
> 	Robert Anton Wilson. 
> 	
> 	Luke comment: I think belief is the distillation of others intelligence. Humans categorise and simplify. which is likely why we are unable to perceive actual reality. Evolution has abstracted us from the complexity that lays beneath our perception.

Because this is love kid, and its all yours. believe me, you're in for one hell of a ride, after all--this is the one thing i know for sure.
