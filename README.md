### Projects at WeWork - *A few samples, many more besides*.

**IPFabric:** At WeWork, I championed and owned the implementation of IPFabric, securing a $500,000 annual investment. We discovered 10,000 devices via SSH and API, leveraging IPFabric’s intent verification to ensure the integrity of circa 150,000 host nodes. I began work to automate IPFabric using the Python SDK with some fruitful efficiencies. As an IPFabric expert, I have since served as an advisor for multiple VC funds prospecting investment in the emerging assurance and observability space.

**Nautobot & Orchestration:** As a member of the Architecture Team at WeWork, I played a pivotal role in advocating for the adoption of Nautobot as our Orchestration Platform, shifting towards a pure Infrastructure as Code approach. I spearheaded the project, securing approval and collaborating with consultants to drive its implementation. The projected return on investment was promising, with anticipated improvements in cost efficiency and customer satisfaction. Regrettably, due to my departure from WeWork, I was unable to see the project through to its completion.

**Juniper Mist Full Stack Refresh:** WeWork needed to evolve and refresh its network estate to enable a simplified global golden standard and the automated delivery of revenue generating Member technology services. A particular focus was best in class Wifi experience. We worked tirelessly to deliver the benefits of the Mist SLE metrics and iterated toward BLE indoor analytics. The multi year project drove business acclaim, reduced ticketing costs, and vastly improved the customer experience.

**WAN Upgrades:** Engineering efforts for transitioning 700 sites from static routes to BGP. While I had championed the adoption of SD-WAN in 2019, the decision had already been made to move to BGP as an interim solution. This project played a crucial role in improving WeWork’s
uptime and customer satisfaction. Despite the significant design work we had done for an SD-WAN implementation, budget constraints prevented its realisation at that time.

**Image Upgrades:** A woeful and pain-ridden process of updating extremely old code at the CLI of hundreds of locations with poor SSH transport. Given the administrative overhead, my team began work to automate all branch network device upgrades, successfully reducing the engineering effort and freeing up much-needed resources for customer-focused work.

**Aruba Clearpass NAC:** Early in my time at WeWork we moved to Clearpass as our NAC 802.1x solution to replace a notorious WPA2 password that received much negative media coverage. The C-Suite demanded a resolution and funding to move at speed. We built Clearpass as 23 instances spanning 5 regions in AWS. The solution was found to be over engineered and with time we stripped out some complexity to refine the solution. The successful transition to individual Member secure EAP authentication to the network assuredly improved NPS and distilled negative media commentary to support the business's reputation.

### Previous Projects - *A few samples from my historic employment*.

**Excel Redstone - *Standard Chartered Bank Cisco ACI Infrastructure Build:*** The Bank engaged us to deliver the cabling, rack stack, patch, base config of 4 financial data centres. I managed the Watford design and build of Cisco Nexus ACI Spine Leaf, Juniper SRX FW, F5 LB, NetApp, ESX & Brocade SAN. The project was delivered on time with good margin and a celebrated customer success press release.

**Excel Redstone - *RBS Data Centre Add, Moves, Changes:*** Early in my career as a Project Manager I would commonly maximise my margin by doing the work myself. I had acquired, at an early stage, the ability to do basic network configuration that businesses used to pay contractors large sums to compete. In this case I leaned into my very early career at layer 1 to deliver 30 consecutive nights of network changes as supervised by the RBS Network team. Both parties were very pleased.

**Dimension Data AI - *Roll Royce CDS Systems:*** A green field deployment of hundreds of Cisco 3850 switches and converged IP infrastructure. Wide ranging collaboration with the Rolls Royce Technologies teams to design a MER DC to a comedically extreme security standard. This project came with much vital learning as we struggled to recover any margin while delivering the scope. I have since adopted a commercial first approach. Everything's better when both sides get value by mutually supporting each other's success.

**Dimension Data AI - *AirBus HQ:*** Project Management of the structured cabling, rack, stack and patch of the Cisco Corporate and isolated Smart Building Networks at AirBus’s prestigious Bristol HQ. 12k terminations and 4k patches to hundreds of switches. Seamlessly delivered. The project was a spectacular high margin success that triggered opportunities to progress.

### Travel and community participation at WeWork

I was fortunate to have ample travel opportunities at WeWork before and following Covid. In 2019 I spent a week at Salesforce Tower in San Francisco for Onboarding and team building. In 2022 I was invited to speak at Cisco Live on topics related to driving and justifying the business value of automation projects with IPFabric. I also attended Juniper AI in Action in Vegas with the Juniper team, and SplunkConf where I met with experts to design and refine our Observability context. In 2022 I visited the new WeWork HQ in NYC to meet with senior stakeholders. And finally, shortly before my departure from WeWork, I was able to attend Cisco Live EMEA where I immersed myself in the DevNet topics.
